# hexadecimal address for bootloader section to begin. To calculate the best value:
# - make clean; make main.hex; ### output will list data: 2124 (or something like that)
# - for the size of your device (8kb = 1024 * 8 = 8192) subtract above value 2124... = 6068
# - How many pages in is that? 6068 / 64 (tiny85 page size in bytes) = 94.8125
# - round that down to 94 - our new bootloader address is 94 * 64 = 6016, in hex = 1780
